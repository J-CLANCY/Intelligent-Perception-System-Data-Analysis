# Intelligent Perception System (IPS) Data Analysis

This repository was created to analyse and visual the data behind my fourth paper as part of my Ph.D. programme. The details of this work can be found in my fourth paper entitled _"Evaluating the Feasibility of Intelligent Blind Road Junction V2I Deployments"_ [1]. The Python code in this repository simply reads in the raw data from the cellular network measurement runs for the IPS and produces the necessary statistics and graphs for reporting in the paper.

## Project Structure

```
├── "".idea"" => Config from PyCharm  
├── ""assets"" => Images and CSS for the Python wrapped web app known as Dash.
├── ""config"" => Contains config for the project.
├── ""output"" => Contains the images/figure outted by the project.
├── ""main.py"" => Contains the Python code that reads in the raw network measurement data and anaylses it and produces a few semi-nice looking graphs.
```
